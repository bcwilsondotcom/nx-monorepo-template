# Feature Specification: NX Monorepo Starter Template

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-is-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "this is a template repo. it is a github public repo that will serve others to easily start nx monorepo projects, with spec driven development using https://github.com/github/spec-kit , openapi for sync stuff, asyncapi for async stuff like event driven architecture using aws event bridge. localstack for aws emulation, terraform for infra as code, devcontainer for standardized dev env, pnpm, nx, jest, and other such tools that make sense for this template."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What is the acceptable time for developers to have a fully configured workspace ready after using the template? ‚Üí A: 5-15 minutes (balanced speed and completeness)
- Q: What types of example projects should the template include to demonstrate its capabilities? ‚Üí A: Full stack: REST API + Event handler + Web app + CLI tool + shared libraries
- Q: Which programming languages should the template support? ‚Üí A: TypeScript + Python (web + data/ML)
- Q: Which CI/CD platforms should the template include configurations for? ‚Üí A: GitHub Actions only (native to GitHub)
- Q: What Node.js version should the template require as minimum? ‚Üí A: Node.js 24+ (latest)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team, I want to quickly bootstrap a new monorepo project with specification-driven development practices, integrated development environment, and cloud-ready infrastructure patterns, so that I can start building scalable applications following established best practices without spending weeks on initial setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to start a new monorepo project, **When** they use this template repository, **Then** they receive a fully configured workspace with build tools, testing frameworks, and development environment ready to use within 5-15 minutes

2. **Given** a team needs to develop both synchronous REST APIs and asynchronous event-driven services, **When** they use the template's specification tools, **Then** they can generate service contracts and implementation stubs automatically from their specifications

3. **Given** developers need to test AWS services locally, **When** they use the provided local development environment, **Then** they can emulate AWS services without incurring cloud costs or requiring AWS credentials

4. **Given** a team wants to manage infrastructure as code, **When** they use the template's infrastructure modules, **Then** they can define, version, and deploy cloud resources consistently across environments

5. **Given** developers from different operating systems join the project, **When** they open the repository in their development environment, **Then** they all receive identical, pre-configured development containers with all required tools installed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GitHub template repository limits are exceeded (100MB file size, 1GB total repository size)?
- How does system handle version conflicts between template updates and existing projects derived from older template versions?
- What happens when developers need tools not included in the template?
- How are breaking changes in the template communicated to existing users?
- What support is provided for migration from older template versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Template MUST provide a complete NX monorepo structure that allows developers to create multiple applications and libraries within a single repository

- **FR-002**: Template MUST include specification-driven development workflows that generate code from API specifications for both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns

- **FR-003**: Template MUST provide local AWS service emulation capabilities that allow developers to test cloud integrations without requiring actual AWS resources

- **FR-004**: Template MUST include infrastructure as code templates that enable consistent deployment of resources across development, staging, and production environments

- **FR-005**: Template MUST provide a standardized development environment that ensures consistency across all developer machines regardless of host operating system

- **FR-006**: Template MUST include comprehensive testing setup supporting unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests

- **FR-007**: Template MUST support package management with workspace capabilities for managing dependencies across multiple projects

- **FR-008**: Template MUST provide build and task orchestration that intelligently manages dependencies between projects and optimizes build times

- **FR-009**: Template MUST include documentation that guides users through initial setup, common workflows, and customization options

- **FR-010**: Template MUST support TypeScript for web applications and services, and Python for data processing and machine learning workloads

- **FR-011**: Repository MUST be publicly accessible on GitHub and usable as a template for creating new repositories

- **FR-012**: Template MUST include example projects demonstrating REST API, event handler, web application, CLI tool, and shared libraries showcasing full stack capabilities

- **FR-013**: Template MUST provide scripts for common development tasks including project generation, testing, building, and deployment

- **FR-014**: Template MUST include configuration for GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for testing, building, and deployment

- **FR-015**: Template MUST maintain compatibility with Node.js 24+ and pnpm 9+ as minimum versions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Template Repository**: The source repository containing all configuration, scripts, and example code that users will copy to start their projects
- **Monorepo Workspace**: The configured environment containing multiple related projects with shared dependencies and tooling
- **Specification Files**: Contract definitions that describe service interfaces and generate implementation code
- **Development Container**: Standardized, portable development environment configuration ensuring consistency across teams
- **Infrastructure Modules**: Reusable infrastructure as code components for cloud resource provisioning

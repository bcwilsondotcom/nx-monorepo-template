# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This document captures the key architectural decisions made for the NX Monorepo Template project.

## ADR-001: Monorepo Strategy with NX

**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Architecture Team

### Context
We needed to choose between a monorepo and polyrepo approach for managing multiple related services and libraries.

### Decision
We chose to implement a monorepo strategy using NX as the build system and workspace manager.

### Rationale
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common libraries and types can be easily shared across projects
- **Atomic Changes**: Cross-service changes can be made in a single commit
- **Unified Tooling**: Single configuration for linting, testing, and building
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified onboarding and development workflow
- **Intelligent Caching**: NX provides advanced caching and task orchestration

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Faster development cycles, better code reuse, simplified CI/CD
- **Negative**: Larger repository size, potential for tighter coupling if not managed properly
- **Mitigation**: Clear service boundaries, dependency graph analysis, affected project detection

## ADR-002: Specification-Driven Development

**Date**: 2024-01-20
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Development Team

### Context
We needed to establish a contract-first approach for API development and ensure type safety across services.

### Decision
Implement specification-driven development using OpenAPI 3.1 for REST APIs and AsyncAPI 2.6 for events.

### Rationale
- **Contract-First**: API contracts defined before implementation
- **Type Safety**: Automatic generation of TypeScript types
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting APIs with interactive documentation
- **Testing**: Contract testing ensures API compliance
- **Tooling**: Rich ecosystem of tools for validation and code generation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better API design, reduced integration issues, improved documentation
- **Negative**: Additional setup complexity, learning curve for new tools
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, training, and automated tooling

## ADR-003: Event-Driven Architecture with AWS EventBridge

**Date**: 2024-01-25
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Architecture Team

### Context
Services need to communicate asynchronously to maintain loose coupling and scalability.

### Decision
Implement event-driven architecture using AWS EventBridge as the central event bus.

### Rationale
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through events rather than direct calls
- **Scalability**: Event-driven systems can handle high throughput
- **Resilience**: Asynchronous processing provides fault tolerance
- **AWS Integration**: Native integration with other AWS services
- **Schema Registry**: Built-in schema evolution and validation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better scalability, resilience, and service independence
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, eventual consistency challenges
- **Mitigation**: Event sourcing patterns, comprehensive monitoring, clear event schemas

## ADR-004: Local Development with LocalStack

**Date**: 2024-02-01
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: DevOps Team, Development Team

### Context
Developers need to test AWS services locally without incurring cloud costs or requiring internet connectivity.

### Decision
Use LocalStack for local AWS service emulation during development and testing.

### Rationale
- **Cost Effective**: No AWS charges for local development
- **Offline Development**: Works without internet connectivity
- **Fast Feedback**: Immediate testing of AWS service integrations
- **Consistent Environment**: Same AWS APIs in local and cloud environments
- **CI/CD Integration**: Can be used in automated testing pipelines

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Faster development cycles, reduced costs, better testing
- **Negative**: Feature parity limitations, additional complexity
- **Mitigation**: Regular testing against real AWS services, clear documentation of limitations

## ADR-005: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

**Date**: 2024-02-05
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: DevOps Team, Architecture Team

### Context
We need to manage cloud infrastructure in a repeatable, version-controlled manner.

### Decision
Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code with modular, reusable configurations.

### Rationale
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Repeatability**: Consistent deployments across environments
- **Modularity**: Reusable Terraform modules for common patterns
- **Multi-Cloud**: Potential for multi-cloud deployments
- **Team Collaboration**: Infrastructure changes through pull requests

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better infrastructure management, reduced deployment errors
- **Negative**: Learning curve, state management complexity
- **Mitigation**: Terraform training, remote state backend, clear module structure

## ADR-006: TypeScript for All Applications

**Date**: 2024-02-10
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context
We need to choose a programming language that provides type safety and developer productivity.

### Decision
Use TypeScript for all applications and libraries in the monorepo.

### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support and autocompletion
- **Maintainability**: Self-documenting code with type annotations
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of typed libraries
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can be adopted incrementally

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Fewer runtime errors, better refactoring support, improved code quality
- **Negative**: Additional compilation step, learning curve for team members
- **Mitigation**: TypeScript training, clear coding standards, build optimization

## ADR-007: Testing Strategy with Multiple Levels

**Date**: 2024-02-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team, QA Team

### Context
We need a comprehensive testing strategy that catches bugs early and ensures system reliability.

### Decision
Implement a multi-level testing strategy with unit, integration, contract, and E2E tests.

### Rationale
- **Early Detection**: Unit tests catch bugs during development
- **Integration Validation**: Integration tests verify service interactions
- **Contract Compliance**: Contract tests ensure API compatibility
- **User Journey**: E2E tests validate complete user workflows
- **Performance**: Load testing ensures system performance

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Higher code quality, reduced production issues, faster debugging
- **Negative**: Increased development time, test maintenance overhead
- **Mitigation**: Test automation, clear testing guidelines, regular test review

## ADR-008: Feature Flags with OpenFeature

**Date**: 2024-02-20
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Product Team, Development Team

### Context
We need the ability to toggle features on/off without deployments and conduct A/B testing.

### Decision
Implement feature flags using OpenFeature standard with Flipt as the flag management system.

### Rationale
- **Deployment Decoupling**: Deploy code without exposing features
- **Risk Mitigation**: Quick rollback of problematic features
- **A/B Testing**: Experimentation with different feature variants
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Progressive feature releases
